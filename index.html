    <p>Hello! I’m Praveen, a motivated and detail-oriented web development enthusiast with a strong passion for building
      modern, user-friendly websites and applications. My journey in technology started out of curiosity, and over time,
      it has transformed into a purposeful path toward becoming a skilled and impactful developer.

      I specialize in creating clean, responsive, and accessible web interfaces using technologies like HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React and Bootstrap. I’m particularly drawn to the challenge of
      transforming ideas into interactive digital experiences that are both functional and beautiful.

      As a continuous learner, I regularly explore the latest trends in web development, from performance optimization
      and UI/UX principles to version control with Git and deploying projects on platforms like GitHub Pages and
      Netlify. I believe that being a great developer is not just about writing code but also about understanding users,
      maintaining good design practices, and staying updated with evolving technologies.

      In addition to building projects, I’m passionate about sharing knowledge—whether it’s through writing blog posts,
      participating in tech communities, or helping peers debug issues. I find joy in the collaborative spirit of
      development and believe that learning is most effective when shared.

      Looking ahead, I aim to further specialize in full-stack development, explore cloud technologies, and eventually
      contribute to open-source projects and real-world applications that make a positive impact.

      When I'm not coding, you’ll likely find me exploring new tools, reading tech articles, or brainstorming ideas for
      my next side project.
